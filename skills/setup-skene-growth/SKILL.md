description: Setup skene-growth dependencies and guide the user through configuration
---

To setup skene-growth:

1. **Check if uvx is installed**: Run `which uvx` or `uvx --version`
2. **Install uvx if needed**: Run `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
3. **Ask user for LLM provider**: Options are "openai", "gemini", "anthropic", "lmstudio", or "ollama". Local providers (lmstudio, ollama) don't need an API key.
4. **Ask user for API key**: If using openai, gemini, or anthropic. Help them get one if needed:
   - OpenAI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Gemini: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
   - Anthropic: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
5. **Create config file**: Create `./.skene-growth.toml` with:
   ```toml
   [llm]
   provider = "<selected-provider>"
   api_key = "<user-provided-api-key>"

   [output]
   output_dir = "./skene-context"
   verbose = false
   ```
6. **Test the setup**: Run `uvx skene-growth analyze .`

Be polite and engaging. If the user already has a config file, ask if they want to update it. Always require api_key in the config even if set in environment variables. Never display the full API key after the user provides it.
